### Overview

I am currently in the process of setting up my research laboratory at Rutgers 
University, so stay tuned for more information. I am affiliated with the 
<a alt="phonolab" href="http://rci.rutgers.edu/~phonolab/index.php" target='_new'><span class="showtooltip" title="Phonolab webpage">Phonology and Field Research Laboratory (PhonoLab)</span></a>, and I am a former member of the 
<a alt="AAPL" href="https://sites.google.com/site/miquelsimonet/sports-lab-az" target='_new'><span class="showtooltip" title="AAPL webpage">Arizona Applied Phonetics Laboratory</span></a> at the University of Arizona. 


My main interests are in phonetics, laboratory phonology, and second language 
acquisition. A principle aim of my research is to better understand the 
relationship between language use and sound representation in the mind, as well 
as the structure of sound systems in human languages. Most of my research is 
conducted on bilinguals of varying proficiency and linguistic experience. 
Feel free to explore the tabs on this page if you are interested in knowing 
more about my research projects.
