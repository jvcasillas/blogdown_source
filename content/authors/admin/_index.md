I am an Assistant Professor of Spanish Linguistics in the 
Spanish and Portuguese Department at Rutgers University, New 
Brunswick. My main interests are in phonetics, laboratory 
phonology, and second language acquisition. A principle aim of 
my research is to better understand the relationship between 
language use and sound representation in the mind, as well as 
the structure of sound systems in human languages. Most of my 
research is conducted on bilinguals of varying proficiency and 
linguistic experience. Some of my recent projects have focused 
on native phonetic experience and its influence on L2 speech 
production, perception and lexical processing. Though my main 
passions are centered around coding, statistical analysis, data 
visualization, and reproducible research, I also enjoy playing 
music, Casio watches and anything related to el andal√∫.
