title: "LaTeX IPA"
---


I made this repository to simplify the process of using IPA in LaTeX. It is merely a collection of snippets for the package [TIPA][TIPA]. To install LaTeX-IPA see the [package control][package control LaTeX-IPA] page.


### File naming  

Consonants are labeled in the following way:  

- voicing -> point of articulation -> mode of articulation  
Ex. voiceless-bilabial-aprox.sublime-snippet = [&beta;]


Vowels are labeled in the following way:  

- vowel -> tense/lax -> height -> frontedness -> rounding  
Ex. vowel-tense-high-front-unrounded.sublime-snippet = [i]


### Tab triggers

There are 6 main groups:  

- **Diacritics**: type "diac" + tab  
- **Vowels**: type "vowel" + tab  

Consonants are divided into four subcategories:  

- **Fricatives** type "fric" + tab  
- **Affricates** type "affr" + tab  
- **Liquids**: type "liquid" + tab  
- **Nasals**: type "nasal" + tab

### Notes  

As of now (10/19/2013), I have only included the symbols that I use the most in English and Spanish. I will continue adding to the repository over time. It should be noted that the consonants do not include all categories (i.e. stops). This is because they are not represented by unsual symbols in IPA.
