### About 

I am an Assistant Professor of Hispanic Linguistics in the Spanish and Portuguese 
Department at Rutgers University, New Brunswick. My main interests are in 
phonetics, laboratory phonology, and second language acquisition. A principle 
aim of my research is to better understand the relationship between language use 
and sound representation in the mind, as well as the structure of sound systems 
in human languages. Most of my research is conducted on bilinguals of varying 
proficiency and linguistic experience. Some of my recent projects have focused 
on native phonetic experience and its influence on L2 speech production, 
perception and lexical processing. Though my main passions are centered around 
coding, statistical analysis, data visualization, and reproducible research, I 
also enjoy playing music, Casio watches and anything related to el andal√∫.
