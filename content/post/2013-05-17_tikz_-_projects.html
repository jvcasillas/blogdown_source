<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>This mini tutorial is part II about incorporating <strong>tikzDevice</strong> into your workflow. It explains the file structure necessary to successfully include <strong>tikzDevice</strong> plots into your <strong>LaTeX document</strong>. You must first have <strong>tikzDevice</strong> installed. If you don’t, see <a href="/blog/2013-05-11_tikz_-_installation/index.html">part I</a> for more information.</p>

<h4>The structure</h4>
<p>A simple yet effective way to do reproducible research is to use <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a> (for statistical analysis) directly in a <strong>LaTeX</strong> environment. There are two ways to accomplish this: (1) Sweave and (2) <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr</a>. Knitr seems to be the better choice, as it builds on some of the deficiencies of Sweave, and is what I am currently using in my workflow. In order to successfully “knit” R code into a .tex format we must use a no-web (.nw) file to create the .tex file. There are two types of no-web files: .Rnw and .Snw. I am not completely sure what the differences are between then, but I use .Rnw and that is what I will mention in this tutorial.</p>
<p>The first step is to create a project folder. For the purposes of this tutorial let’s call this folder “master”. Next, we will need some data and some R code that analyzes it. The most common, no-hassle way to accomplish this in R is to save your R code in a separate .R file. For this tutorial, we will call our data “my-data.txt” and our R code “example.R”. The fake data we are going to analyze is for a two-alternative forced choice identification experiment. So, our fake data is in the “my-data.txt” file and the R code that analyzes it is in the example.R file.</p>
<p>The next step is to create the “no web” .Rnw file. This is as simple as creating a document in your text editor of choice (I use <a href="https://github.com/textmate/textmate">TextMate 2</a> and <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text 3</a>) and saving it with a .Rnw extension. For this tutorial we will call this file “example.Rnw”. Its purpose is to call the R code written in “example.R” (which uses the fake data in “my-data.txt”) in order to produce a .tex file (in this case “example.tex”). Still with me? Good.</p>
<p>Next we need to prepare where we are going to keep the plots produced by tikzDevice. I find it most convenient to have a specific folder, “plots_folder”, where I only keep the tikzDevice plots. So, create this folder inside the “master” folder. TikzDevice creates the R plots and converts them to a LaTeX format (the benefits of this are further explained in part III of this tutorial), saves them in “plots_folder” and we will then include them in the example.tex file which can be compiled into a PDF. The image below shows what this should look like when it’s all said and done.</p>
