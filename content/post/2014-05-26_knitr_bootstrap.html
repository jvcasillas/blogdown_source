<p>Knitr bootstrap makes generating standalone reports extremely easy and the output looks really neat. Check out the example <a href="/blog/assets/knitr_bootstrap/knitr_bootstrap.html">here</a>. To recreate this you need to download the preview release of <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html">R Studio</a>, and set up the front matter as follows:</p>
<pre><code>---
output:
  knitrBootstrap::bootstrap_document:
    title: &quot;&quot;
    theme: default
    highlight: sunburst
    theme.chooser: TRUE
    highlight.chooser: TRUE
---</code></pre>
