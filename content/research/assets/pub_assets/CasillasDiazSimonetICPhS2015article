<p class="minip">This study explores the acoustic correlates that distinguish 
coronal stops (/t/, /d/) between English and Spanish. English and Spanish 
coronal stops are hypothesized to differ in terms of voice-onset time and place 
of articulation. We are particularly concerned with capturing the place of 
articulation difference with acoustic data, as the voice-onset time difference 
is well known. Specifically, we focus on English /d/ and Spanish /t/, which are 
phonetically-voiceless stops with a short-lag voice-onset time. Spanish /t/ has 
been described as being articulated at dental place, whereas English /d/ is 
articulated at alveolar place. Mixed-effects models explored various spectral 
measurements of the consonant burst and found that standard deviation, relative 
burst intensity, and center of gravity differed as a function of place of 
articulation (or language).</p>
