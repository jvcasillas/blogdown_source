<p class="minip">The present work explored the initial stages of adult L2 
learning with a focus on the acquisition of the target language sound system. 
Specifically, the study analyzed the development of Spanish stop voicing in an 
immersion learning context in which L1 use was minimal and L2 input was 
maximized. Native English speaking learners of Spanish and bilinguals provided 
production data that were analyzed using Bayesian multilevel models. The 
analyses included a pre/post program evaluation of stop voicing in a delayed 
shadowing task, as well as a comparison with the participants' post-program 
production in a task that required semantic processing. The analyses revealed 
phonetic learning for stop voicing over the course of the program, though 
production gains diminished when the task required semantic processing. The 
results suggest L2 phonetic category formation can occur at an early stage of 
development, but L2 phonetic representations are unstable during initial 
stages of learning.</p>
