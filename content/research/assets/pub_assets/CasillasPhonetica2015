<p class="minip">The present study explored the production and perception of the 
/i/-/ɪ/ vowel contrast in second language (L2)-dominant early learners of 
American English who no longer fluently speak their first language (L1, 
Spanish). The production task analyzed the extent to which the early learner 
group differed from controls (native English speakers and L1-Spanish late-onset 
learners of English) with regard to duration and spectral centroids. The 
perception experiment examined how these early learners classified resynthesized 
stimuli drawn from the /i/-/ɪ/ con- trast using distinct acoustic cues – 
spectral and temporal – in a 2-alternative forced choice identification task. 
The first experiment revealed that the early learners produced the contrast in 
a native-like manner in terms of the spectral envelope and duration use. The 
second experiment found that early learners differed from both control groups 
in how they categorized the /i/-/ɪ/ continua based on spectrum and duration, 
and the extent to which they rely on these two cues. The effects of linguistic 
experience on L2 phonetic behavior are discussed.</p>
