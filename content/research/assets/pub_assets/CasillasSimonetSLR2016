<p class="minip">This study investigates how fluent second-language (L2) 
learners of English produce and perceive the /æ/–/ɑ/ vowel contrast of 
Southwestern American English. Two learner groups are examined: (1) early, 
proficient English speakers who were raised by Spanish-speaking families but 
who became dominant in English during childhood and, as adults, lack 
communicative abilities in Spanish, and (2) Spanish-speaking late learners of 
English who continue to be dominant in Spanish. The participants provided data 
in three tasks: one production and two perceptual. The study finds that both 
learner groups differ from native controls in their production and perception 
of the /æ/–/ɑ/ contrast. The findings shed light on our understanding of the 
relative effects of age (at onset of language exposure) and language dominance 
(at time of testing) by showing that sequential bilingualism impacts phonetic 
behavior even when speakers have become dominant in the target language.</p>
