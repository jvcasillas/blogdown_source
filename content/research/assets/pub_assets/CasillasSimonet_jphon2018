<p class="minip">In the present study, Spanish-English bilinguals’ perceptual 
boundaries between voiced and voiceless stops (a /b/-/p/ continuum including 
pre-voiced, voiceless unaspirated, and voiceless aspirated tokens) are shown 
to be modulated by whether participants are “led to believe” they are 
classifying Spanish or English sounds. In Experiment 1, simultaneous 
Spanish-English bilinguals and beginner second-language learners of Spanish 
labeled the same acoustic continuum in two experimental sessions (Spanish 
mode, English mode), and both groups were found to display language-specific 
perceptual boundaries (or session effects). In Experiment 2, early bilinguals 
and late second-language learners of various levels of proficiency 
participated in a single session in which, in random order, they labeled 
nonwords that were designed to prime either Spanish or English language modes. 
Early bilinguals and relatively proficient second-language learners, but not 
less proficient learners, displayed mode-specific perceptual normalization 
criteria even in conditions of rapid, random mode switching. Along with 
similar ones, the experiments reported here demonstrate that bilinguals are 
able to exploit language-specific perceptual processes (or norms) when 
processing speech sounds, which entails some degree of separation between 
their sound systems.</p>
