<p class="minip">We use visual-world eye-tracking and gating methods to 
investigate whether Spanish monolinguals and English late learners of Spanish 
use prosodic cues (lexical stress) to anticipate morphological information 
(suffixes) during spoken word recognition, and if they do, whether L2 
proficiency and working memory (WM) mediate their anticipatory abilities. Our 
findings show that the monolinguals used prosodic information to predict word 
endings in both tasks, regardless of first-syllable stress (stressed, 
unstressed) and structure (CV, CVC). In contrast, the beginning learners did 
not use prosodic information to anticipate word suffixes in any task or 
condition. Importantly, the advanced learners mirrored the monolinguals, except 
in words with first-syllable CV structure, but were slower than the 
monolinguals. Finally, WM was not associated with anticipatory eye movements, 
though results were inconclusive for offline processing. Taken together, the 
present study shows that suprasegmental information facilitates morphological 
anticipation during spoken word recognition, and that adult learners can gain 
anticipatory processing patterns qualitatively, but not quantitatively, similar 
to monolinguals.</p>
